 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction & Revenue Impact Analysis
                     
Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by telecom companies, directly impacting revenue and growth.
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to identify churn drivers, predict customers likely to leave, and quantify revenue loss due to churn, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

The project combines exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and business impact analysis to deliver actionable insights.

 Business Objectives
Identify key factors contributing to customer churn

Predict customers with high churn probability

Analyze revenue loss caused by churn

Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve retention

 Dataset
Source: IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Access Method: Loaded directly via public dataset URL using Pandas

 Project Workflow
1️1) Data Understanding & Cleaning

Inspected data structure and distributions

Handled missing values and incorrect data types

Removed irrelevant identifiers

2️) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed churn patterns across contract types

Studied impact of tenure and monthly charges on churn

Visualized key customer behavior trends

3️) Feature Engineering

Created tenure-based customer segments

Identified high-value customers

Engineered features to improve model performance

4) Predictive Modeling

Built and evaluated:

Logistic Regression (baseline model)

Random Forest Classifier (advanced model)

Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5)Revenue Impact Analysis

Estimated revenue loss caused by churn

Identified high-risk, high-value customers

Quantified potential revenue savings through churn reduction

Key Insights
Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn rates

New customers are more likely to churn than long-tenure customers

Higher monthly charges increase churn probability

Certain service combinations contribute more to churn

 Business Recommendations
Encourage long-term contracts through targeted incentives

Proactively engage high-risk customers with retention offers

Improve service quality in churn-prone segments

Focus retention efforts on high-value customers to maximize revenue savings

 Business Impact

This analysis demonstrates how predictive analytics can help telecom companies:

Reduce customer churn

Protect high-value revenue streams

Improve customer lifetime value

Enable proactive, data-driven decision making

 Conclusion
The project showcases an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, combining technical skills with strong business understanding.
It highlights how data analytics and machine learning can be leveraged to solve real-world business problems and drive measurable impact.
